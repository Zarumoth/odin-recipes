        <ul>
            <li>350 g firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons groundnut oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon cornflour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1fresh red chilli, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>5 cm piece of ginger</li>
            <li>320 g asparagus</li>
            <li>150 g beansprouts</li>
            <li>200 g rice noodles, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place 350g of firm tofu on a plate lined with kitchen paper, then place another layer of<br>kitchen paper on top - this will help soak up some of the moisture. Set aside until ready to<br>use.</li>
            <li>Place a large frying pan over a medium heat, carefully cut<br>the tofu into quarters, then cut each piece into four again. Add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil<br>to the pan, then add the tofu and leave to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden and crisp,<br>turning halfway. Remove to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Toast 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds in the pan, then toss with the tofu to coat.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix ½ a tablespoon of cornflour, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1<br>tablespoon of white wine vinegar until combined.</li>
            <li>Peel and finely chop 1 clove of garlic and trim and finely slice 1 fresh red chilli. Peel a 5cm<br>piece of ginger, then slice into matchsticks. Snap the woody ends from 320g asparagus, and<br>slice on the bias.</li>
            <li>Place a wok over a high heat and add 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil. Once hot, stir in the<br>garlic, chilli and ginger, followed by the asparagus and 150g of beansprouts. Cook for a<br>couple of minutes, or until everything is fragrant and golden, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cornflour mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or<br>until the sauce has thickened, adding a splash of water, if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the veggies alongside the tofu with some extra sliced red chilli and cooked rice<br>noodles, if you like</li>
        </ol>
