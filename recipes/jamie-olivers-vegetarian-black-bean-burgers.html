        <img src="../images/jamie-olivers-black-bean-burger.jpg" alt="A juicy black bean burger">

        <p>&ldquo;These veggie burgers are packed with protein, a nutrient that is often lacking from a vegetarian diet.<br>But of course, you don&rsquo;t have to be a vegetarian to enjoy these!<br>Oozy mozzarella, punchy balsamic onions and a tangy, crunchy slaw make this dish a weeknight staple,<br>and you can whip it up in under an hour.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p><strong>Yield: 4 servings</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>1½ red onions</li>
            <li>½ pound mixed fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>3½ ounces rye bread, torn into ½-inch pieces (about 2½ cups)</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and roughly mashed with a fork</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil, as needed</li>
            <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>4 large brioche rolls, potato rolls or burger buns</li>
            <li>4 ounces cherry tomatoes, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>Chipotle hot sauce, as needed</li>
            <li>1 ripe mango</li>
            <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
            <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>4 fresh cilantro sprigs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel and roughly chop 1 onion, then place it in a<br> food processor. Add the mushrooms and pulse until just finely chopped. (Be<br>careful not to overprocess into a paste.) Transfer mixture to a large bowl and wipe<br>out the bowl of the food processor. Add torn bread to the processor, pulse until it<br>forms fine crumbs, then transfer crumbs to the mushroom mixture.</li>
            <li>Add black beans and coriander, season well with salt and pepper, then mix<br>together until thoroughly combined. Divide into 4 equal portions and shape into 1-<br>inch-thick patties. Rub all over with oil and dust with ground coriander, then place<br>on an oiled baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast patties until dark and crisp, 35 to 45 minutes. Sprinkle the burgers with<br>the Cheddar. Let burgers cool slightly to firm up. While the burgers cool, transfer the<br>buns to the hot oven and heat for a few minutes until toasted.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel and very finely chop the remaining ½ onion. Transfer to a<br>medium bowl. Add the tomatoes. Zest the lime on top, then halve the lime and<br>squeeze lime juice on top, to taste. Add a few shakes of hot sauce and season with<br>salt and pepper to taste. Pit, peel and finely slice the mango and avocado.</li>
            <li>Spread the yogurt on the bases of the rolls or buns, then top with half the salsa,<br>the mango and the avocado. Add the burgers, the remaining salsa, extra Tabasco<br>and cilantro leaves, then pop the lids on, press down lightly and serve<br>immediately.</li>
        </ol>
