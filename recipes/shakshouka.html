        <p>&ldquo;Harissa adds warmth and a ray of much-needed sunshine to this<br>twist on a Middle-Eastern classic. It&rsquo;s a one-pan wonder!&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p><strong>Yield: 4 servings</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>200 g potatoes</li>
            <li>200 g butternut squash</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>3 mixed-color peppers</li>
            <li>½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g)</li>
            <li>2 gloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rose harissa</li>
            <li>1 x 400g tin of quality plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Scrub the potatoes and squash (deseed if needed), slice into 1cm-thick chips, then<br>place in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil.</li>
            <li>Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, adding them to the pan as you go.</li>
            <li>Pick the parsley leaves, finely slicing the stalks. Peel and finely slice the garlic and add<br>to the pan with the parsley stalks, fennel seeds, paprika and cumin, then cover and cook<br>for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Flick over the harissa and scrunch in the tomatoes, then stir in ¼ of a tin&rsquo;s worth of water,<br>pop the lid back on and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the potatoes and squash are<br>soft, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, stir in the parsley leaves and season with a pinch of sea salt, then cook<br>until the sauce has thickened and reduced.</li>
            <li>Make 4 wells with the back of a spoon, crack in the eggs, pop the lid on and cook the eggs<br>to your liking. Nice served with warm flatbreads and extra harissa, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
